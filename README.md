## **History of JavaScript**  
JavaScript (JS) was created by **Brendan Eich** in **1995** while he was working at Netscape Communications. It was originally called **Mocha**, then renamed **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript**.  

### **Key Milestones in JavaScript's History**  
1. **1995** ‚Äì Brendan Eich develops JavaScript in **10 days** for Netscape Navigator 2.  
2. **1996** ‚Äì Microsoft creates **JScript**, a variant of JavaScript, for Internet Explorer 3.  
3. **1997** ‚Äì JavaScript becomes an official standard as **ECMAScript (ES1)** under **ECMA International**.  
4. **2009** ‚Äì **ES5** introduces features like `JSON`, `strict mode`, and improved array methods.  
5. **2015** ‚Äì **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** brings **let, const, arrow functions, classes, and promises**.  
6. **2017-Present** ‚Äì Features like async/await, optional chaining, and new APIs improve JavaScript for modern applications.  

Today, JavaScript is the **most popular** programming language for web development, used both on the client-side and server-side (via Node.js).

## **History of Search Engines**  
Search engines help users find web pages on the internet. They have evolved significantly since the early days of the web.  

### **Key Milestones in Search Engine History**  
1. **1990 ‚Äì Archie:** The first search engine, **Archie**, indexed FTP files but did not provide text search.  
2. **1993 ‚Äì ALIWEB:** The first web-based search engine, created by **Martijn Koster**.  
3. **1994 ‚Äì Yahoo! Directory:** A manually curated directory rather than a true search engine.  
4. **1996 ‚Äì Backrub (Google‚Äôs Prototype):** **Larry Page and Sergey Brin** developed **Backrub**, later renamed **Google**.  
5. **1998 ‚Äì Google Launched:** Google introduced **PageRank**, revolutionizing web search.  
6. **2000 ‚Äì Google AdWords:** The introduction of advertising in search results.  
7. **2004 ‚Äì Web 2.0 & Personalization:** Search engines started personalizing search results.  
8. **2011 ‚Äì Google Panda Update:** Improved search quality by penalizing low-quality websites.  
9. **2015 ‚Äì Mobile-first Indexing:** Google started prioritizing mobile-friendly sites.  
10. **2023-Present ‚Äì AI Search & Generative AI:** Search engines integrate AI (like **Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot**) to provide more interactive search experiences.  

### **What is an API?**
API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines how requests and responses should be made and processed.

In simple terms, an API acts as a **waiter** in a restaurant:
- You (the client) give your order (request) to the waiter (API).
- The waiter takes it to the kitchen (server).
- The kitchen prepares the food (processes the request).
- The waiter brings the food back to you (response).

---

### **Formats of API Responses**
APIs typically return data in **structured formats**. The most common ones are:
1. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) ‚Äì Most widely used**
2. **XML (Extensible Markup Language) ‚Äì Used in older systems**
3. **Plain Text or HTML ‚Äì Sometimes used in web APIs**

---

### **Real-Life Example of an API**
#### **1. Weather API**
- You open a weather app and check today's temperature.
- The app sends a request to a weather API like OpenWeather.
- The API responds with the temperature in JSON format.
- The app displays the temperature to you.

#### **2. Online Payments (Paytm, Google Pay, UPI)**
- You make a payment using Google Pay.
- Google Pay‚Äôs API communicates with your bank‚Äôs API.
- Your bank processes the payment and returns a success or failure message.

---

### **What is JSON?**
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for APIs. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse.

#### **Example JSON Response from a Weather API**
```json
{
  "city": "Kolkata",
  "temperature": 32,
  "humidity": 65,
  "description": "Sunny"
}
```

---

### **Relationship Between APIs and JSON**
- APIs **send and receive data** in JSON format because it is lightweight and widely supported.
- JSON allows **structured** and **organized** data transfer.
- It is **language-independent**, meaning APIs in Python, JavaScript, or C++ can all use JSON.

# JavaScript Closures
In JavaScript, a closure is created when a function is defined within another function, allowing the inner function to access variables and parameters of the outer function even after the outer function has finished executing. This is because the inner function maintains a reference to its lexical environment, which includes all the variables in scope at the time of its creation

Great! Since you're preparing for interviews, I'll give you an **interview-focused deep dive** into JavaScript's execution model‚Äîcovering everything you need to know to **explain confidently in interviews**, with real examples, edge cases, and insights.

# üöÄ JavaScript Execution Model 

---

## üß† 1. What is an **Execution Context**?

An **Execution Context (EC)** is the environment where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.  

Think of it as a **container** with:
- **Variable Environment** ‚Äì stores variables, functions, parameters.
- **Lexical Environment** ‚Äì info about the surroundings of the code.
- **`this` Binding** ‚Äì depends on how the function is called.

---

### ‚úÖ Types of Execution Contexts:

| Type                     | Description                                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global Execution Context | Created when the JS file starts executing. Only once.      |
| Function Execution Context | Created every time a function is invoked.                |
| Eval Execution Context   | Created when code is executed inside `eval()` (rarely used) |

---

## üßæ 2. Two Phases of Code Execution in JS

Each Execution Context goes through **two phases**:

---

### üîπ **1. Memory Creation Phase (a.k.a. Hoisting Phase)**

- Memory is allocated for **variables and functions**.
- **Variable declarations** (`var`) are hoisted with `undefined`.
- **Function declarations** are hoisted **with their full definition**.

üëâ Example:
```js
console.log(x); // undefined
console.log(greet()); // Hello

var x = 10;
function greet() {
  return "Hello";
}
```

**Under the hood (Memory Phase):**
```js
x ‚Üí undefined
greet ‚Üí function() { return "Hello"; }
```

---

### üîπ **2. Execution Phase**

Now JS executes the code line-by-line:
- Assigns actual values to variables
- Invokes functions

So `x = 10` is updated, and `greet()` is executed.

---

## üö® Interview Tip: Hoisting Differences

| Declaration Type | Hoisted? | Initialized? | Temporal Dead Zone? |
|------------------|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| `var`            | Yes      | `undefined`  | No                   |
| `let`/`const`    | Yes      | ‚ùå (Not initialized) | ‚úÖ Yes        |

### Example:
```js
console.log(a); // undefined
console.log(b); // ReferenceError
var a = 5;
let b = 10;
```

---

## üîÅ 3. Call Stack ‚Äì The Execution Tracker

JS uses a **Call Stack** (LIFO ‚Äì Last In, First Out) to manage execution contexts.

### Example:
```js
function one() {
  console.log("One");
  two();
}

function two() {
  console.log("Two");
}

one();
```

### Call Stack Flow:
```
PUSH: Global()
PUSH: one()
PUSH: two()
POP: two()
POP: one()
POP: Global()
```

Each function call creates a new **Function Execution Context** that gets **pushed to the stack**, and removed once done.

---

## üîç 4. Components of Execution Context

Each EC has:

### ‚úÖ a) **Variable Environment**
- Stores function arguments, `var` declarations, and function declarations.

### ‚úÖ b) **Lexical Environment**
- Reference to the parent EC (scope chain).

### ‚úÖ c) **`this` Binding**
- Global EC ‚Üí `this` refers to global object (window in browser).
- Inside functions ‚Üí depends on how function is called (can be `undefined`, global object, or custom object).

---

## üìå 5. Execution Context vs Scope Chain vs Lexical Scope

- **Scope Chain** ‚Äì Chain of references to parent environments for resolving variables.
- **Lexical Scope** ‚Äì Based on where functions are written (not called).

üëâ Example:
```js
function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a); // uses outer‚Äôs variable via scope chain
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
```

---

## üìö 6. Bonus: Arrow Functions and `this`

Arrow functions **don‚Äôt have their own `this`**. They use `this` from the surrounding lexical context.

```js
const obj = {
  name: "John",
  sayHi: () => {
    console.log(this.name); // undefined
  }
};

obj.sayHi(); // ‚ö†Ô∏è Not "John"
```

Use a normal function if you need dynamic `this`.

# üìò JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers

A comprehensive list of frequently asked JavaScript interview questions with clear answers and examples.

---

## üìå 1. What is Hoisting in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Hoisting is JavaScript‚Äôs behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.

- `var` is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
- `function` declarations are hoisted completely.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized (TDZ ‚Äì Temporal Dead Zone).

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 20;
```

---

## üìå 2. What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?

| Feature       | `var`         | `let`         | `const`       |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Scope         | Function       | Block         | Block         |
| Hoisting      | Yes            | Yes (TDZ)     | Yes (TDZ)     |
| Reassignable  | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå             |
| Redeclarable  | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå             |

---

## üìå 3. What is an Execution Context?

**Answer:**  
An execution context is the environment where JavaScript code is executed.

**Types:**
- Global Execution Context
- Function Execution Context
- Eval Execution Context

Each has:
- Variable Environment
- Lexical Environment
- `this` binding

---

## üìå 4. What is the Call Stack?

**Answer:**  
The call stack is a stack structure (LIFO) that keeps track of function calls.

```js
function a() {
  b();
}
function b() {
  console.log('Hello');
}
a();
```

Call Stack:
```
Global -> a() -> b() -> pop -> pop
```

---

## üìå 5. What are Closures?

**Answer:**  
A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope, even after the outer function has finished.

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

---

## üìå 6. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

- `==` ‚Üí loose equality (allows type coercion)
- `===` ‚Üí strict equality (no coercion)

```js
'5' == 5    // true
'5' === 5   // false
```

---

## üìå 7. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

|               | `undefined`          | `null`                     |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Type          | undefined             | object                     |
| Meaning       | Declared but not assigned | Explicitly empty       |

---

## üìå 8. Function Declaration vs Function Expression

**Function Declaration:**
```js
function greet() {
  return "Hi";
}
```

‚úÖ Hoisted

**Function Expression:**
```js
const greet = function() {
  return "Hi";
};
```

‚ùå Not hoisted

---

## üìå 9. What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?

**Answer:**  
A function that runs immediately after it is defined.

```js
(function() {
  console.log("IIFE running");
})();
```

---

## üìå 10. What is the Event Loop?

**Answer:**  
The event loop allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations using:

- Call Stack
- Web APIs
- Callback Queue

```js
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);
console.log("End");
```

Output:
```
Start
End
Timeout
```

---

## üìå 11. What is a Promise?

**Answer:**  
A Promise represents a value that may be available now, or later, or never.

```js
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("Success!");
});
p.then(data => console.log(data));
```

---

## üìå 12. What are Arrow Functions?

**Answer:**  
Arrow functions:
- Are shorter in syntax
- Do **not** have their own `this`, `arguments`, or `super`
- Cannot be used as constructors

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

---

## üìå 13. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Code

- **Synchronous**: Code executes line-by-line.
- **Asynchronous**: Allows non-blocking code execution.

```js
console.log("1");
setTimeout(() => console.log("2"), 0);
console.log("3");
// Output: 1, 3, 2
```

---

## üìå 14. What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?

**Answer:**  
The phase between hoisting and declaration where `let` and `const` variables can't be accessed.

```js
console.log(x); // ReferenceError
let x = 5;
```

---

## üìå 15. What are Higher-Order Functions?

**Answer:**  
Functions that take other functions as arguments or return a function.

```js
function greet(fn) {
  fn();
}
greet(() => console.log("Hello"));
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Cheat Sheet

- **Hoisting**: Variables/functions moved to top
- **Execution Context**: Env in which code runs
- **Call Stack**: Stack to manage function calls
- **Closures**: Inner function remembers outer variables
- **Promises**: Handle async operations
- **Arrow Functions**: Shorter syntax, lexical `this`
- **TDZ**: Area where `let`/`const` not initialized
- **IIFE**: Function that executes immediately

# DOM
## window-> document->html
 ## html->1) head 2)body.
 head-> 1)title 2)meta ...... title-> text node ...... meta -> attribute
 body -> div -> div has attribute.
 div-> h1 and p as child and h1 has attribute and text node in p we have only text node.
